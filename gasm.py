Genome Assembly Using Reads

Given: A collection S of (error-free) reads of equal length (not exceeding 50
bp). In this dataset, for some positive integer k, the de Bruijn graph Bk on
Sk+1âˆªSrck+1 consists of exactly two directed cycles.

Return: A cyclic superstring of minimal length containing every read or its
reverse complement.
