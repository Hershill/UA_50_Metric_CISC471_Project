# Deterring the Manipulation of N50 Assembly Quality Scoring

This project contains the programming implementation for our Group Project. The code was written using Python 3.8+.

Our chosen algorithm to analyse was [Assessing Assembly Quality with N50 and N75](http://rosalind.info/problems/asmq/).

## File structure

The project contains the following files:

```
.
├── main.py                        # Runs the unittests for the entier codebase and all algorithms implemented
├── asmq_extension.py              # Contains the implementations of the extension to the asssemby acoring algorithms
├── asmq_extension_test.py         # Contains the implementations of the Python unittests for the extension problem 
├── XXXX.py                        # Contains the implementations of teh Rosaling problem given by the XXXX abbreviation
├── XXXX_test.py                   # Contains the implementations of teh Rosaling problem given by the XXXX abbreviation
├── sample_data_generator.py       # Contains the implementation of a data generator to generate data sets that the assembly quality algorithms can be run on
├── helpers.py                     # Contains common helper functions used accross the different algorithms
├── unittests.py                   # Contains the unit tests for the implemented algorithms
├── rosalind_XXXX_{1,2,3}.py       # Contains the sample data for the positive unittests for corresponding problem XXXX
├── rosalind_XXXX_4.py             # Contains the sample data for the negative unittests for corresponding problem XXXX
├── rosalind_XXXX_{1,2,3}_sol.py   # Some solutions were too large to include directly in the .py testing file, and are therefore contained in these files
└── README.md                      # This file, contians information about the program
```

## Running the programs

The following command can be used to run all the unittests for the problems solved in this project:

- `python main.py`

### Overview

The solutions for the programming question are contained in `XXXX.py`, where `XXXX` corresponds to the lettered
abbreviation for a problem on Rosalind. The problems can be individually run from their `XXXX.py` file or by
running the corresponding `XXXX_test.py` file or all unitests by running `main.py`,
depending on whether you would like to run the individual functions or the unit tests. See below for more details.

### Running unittests and individual functions

Unittests:
- Running `main.py` or using the commands above will run the unittests written for the
required functions.

Individual Functions:
- There are some commented out lines in the main methods of `XXXX.py` and these can be uncommented or
modified to run the problem sets individually.

## Experiment Results and Automated Data Generation for LaTeX

There are two ways to visualize and collate the data for the experiments conducted in this project:

- Using `figures.py` to generate CSV files for use in the LaTeX documentation
- Using `asmq_extension.py` to generate tabular data output in the python console

Experiment parameters can be adjusted and set before running figures.py

Running `asmq_extension.py` can be used to view individual tables and output to the python conosle given parameters
which can be adjusted before running the file.

Exported to csv, can be replaced with the files in the directory of the `.tex` file

Compiling the `.tex` file will now inlay the 

CSV files generated from running `figures.py`

## Software Verification

- Analysis using [Radon](https://pypi.org/project/radon/) was parfomred and our code was given the following score for
  Cyclomatic Complexity using the following command:
    - Command: `radon cc -e "venv/*" -a -s .`
    - Output:`Average complexity: A (2.1538461538461537)`
- Conducted [Pylint](https://pylint.org/) static analysis using parameters specified in `.pylintrc` to conform
  development of code to required style
  - Output: `Your code has been rated at 9.68/10`
- All Rosalind based problem that were solved leading up to ASMQ passed on multiple trial of test data generated by Rosalind
    - In order to unlock the ASMQ project on Rosalind and it's sample data for testing, all previous dependent problems
      had to be correctly solved
    - Multiple trial of ASMQ data passed on Rosalind with our implementation of the algorithm, giving us a confident
      baseline for the development of the extension algorithm in `asmq_extension.py`
- All testing for our extension was done using unittests on both the implemented algorithms and data generator algorithms
